	<h2>Perl (Still a draft post)</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>Variables in Perl are WIERD! Depending on the code around them they will evaluate to vastly different values. 
	Part of the wierdness stems from how different variable types. $ as a preface denotes scalar values; in Perl scalars
	are any pure value. That includes Strings, Integers, and references to variables. @ denotes arrays; & denotes subroutines.
	With this type system, Perl coerces from expressions to match the variables being assigned.</p>
	<p>One example of such a coercion is:</p>
	@array =  (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7); #works just like expected<br>
	$scalar = @array; #acts pretty wierd <br>
	<p>What would you expect the secound line to do? Get a value? Get a reference to the array? Well if you thought either 
	of those you'd be wrong. It actually equals the length of @array.</p>
	$scalar = (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7);#not the same as before <br>
	<p>The difference between the the two different peices of code is very subtle. $scalar in this case equals 7, the last element.
